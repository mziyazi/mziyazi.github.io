    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an energy decomposition method to improve the numerical stability of time-evolving magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) coronal models, enabling them to resolve the stronger magnetic field during solar maxima without significantly filtering out small-scale structures from the observed magnetograms.We advance the decomposed energy that excludes the magnetic energy, instead of the total energy, in time. It avoids the operation of subtracting a large magnetic energy from the total energy to obtain a very small thermal pressure in low-beta regions, thereby improving the numerical stability of MHD models. We implemented this method in COCONUT and validated the model by performing a time-evolving coronal simulation during Carrington Rotation (CR) 2296, a solar maximum CR. We also compare quasi-steady-state simulation results during the solar minimum and the increasing phase, calculated using both versions of COCONUT adopting the decomposed energy equation and the traditional full energy equation to further validate the reliability of the energy decomposition method. The simulation results show that the energy decomposition method yields results nearly identical to those of the traditional full energy equation during solar minimum, while significantly enhancing COCONUT's ability to simulate coronal evolution under strong magnetic fields, even those exceeding 100 Gauss. This method is well suited for performing quasi-realistic time-evolving coronal simulations around solar maxima without excessively filtering out the observed strong magnetic fields.",

    "abstract": "Time-evolving magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) coronal modeling, driven by a series of time-dependent photospheric magnetograms, represents a new generation of coronal simulations. This approach offers more realistic results than traditional steady coronal models constrained by a static magnetogram. However, its practical application is significantly limited by the low computational efficiency and poor numerical stability in solving low-β issues common in coronal simulations. To address this, we propose an extended magnetic field decomposition strategy and successfully implement it in an implicit MHD coronal model. The traditional decomposition strategies split the magnetic field into a time-invariant potential field and a time-dependent component B<SUB>1</SUB>. This works well for quasi-steady-state coronal simulations where ∣B<SUB>1</SUB>∣ is typically small. However, when the inner-boundary magnetic field evolves, ∣B<SUB>1</SUB>∣ can grow significantly, and its discretization errors often lead to nonphysical negative thermal pressure, ultimately causing the simulation to crash. In the extended magnetic field decomposition strategy, we split the magnetic field into a temporally piecewise-constant field and a time-varying component, B<SUB>1</SUB>. This effectively keeps ∣B<SUB>1</SUB>∣ consistently small throughout the simulations and performs well in solving time-evolving low-β issues, thereby outperforming traditional methods. We incorporate this improved strategy into our implicit MHD coronal model and apply it to simulate the evolution of coronal structures within 0.1 au over two solar-maximum Carrington rotations. The results show that this coronal model effectively captures observational features and performs more than 80 times faster than real-time evolutions using only 192 CPU cores, making it well suited for practical applications in simulating the time-evolving corona.",

    "abstract": "Recent polarimetric mm-observations of the galactic centre showed sinusoidal loops in the $\\mathcal {Q{\\small --}U}$ plane with a duration of one hour. The loops coincide with a quasi-simultaneous X-ray flare. A promising mechanism to explain the flaring events are magnetic flux eruptions in magnetically arrested accretion flows (MAD). In our previous work, we studied the accretion flow dynamics during flux eruptions. Here, we extend our previous study by investigating whether polarization loops can be a signature produced by magnetic flux eruptions. We find that loops in the $\\mathcal {Q{\\small --}U}$ plane are robustly produced in MAD models as they lead to enhanced emissivity of compressed disc material due to orbiting flux bundles. A timing analysis of the synthetic polarized light curves demonstrate a polarized excess variability at time-scales of $\\simeq 1~\\rm h$. The polarization loops are also clearly imprinted on the cross-correlation of the Stokes parameters which allows us to extract a typical periodicity of $30~\\rm min$ to $1~\\rm h$ with some evidence for a spin dependence. These results are intrinsic to the MAD state and should thus hold for a wide range of astrophysical objects. A subset of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations without saturated magnetic flux, namely, single temperature standard and normal evolution models, also produces $\\mathcal {Q{\\small --}U}$ loops. However, in disagreement with the observations, loops in these simulations are quasi-continuous with a low polarization excess.",

    "abstract": "In a companion paper, we present the first spatially resolved polarized image of Sagittarius A* on event horizon scales, captured using the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometric array operating at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. Here we interpret this image using both simple analytic models and numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. The large spatially resolved linear polarization fraction (24%–28%, peaking at ∼40%) is the most stringent constraint on parameter space, disfavoring models that are too Faraday depolarized. Similar to our studies of M87*, polarimetric constraints reinforce a preference for GRMHD models with dynamically important magnetic fields. Although the spiral morphology of the polarization pattern is known to constrain the spin and inclination angle, the time-variable rotation measure (RM) of Sgr A* (equivalent to ≈46° ± 12° rotation at 228 GHz) limits its present utility as a constraint. If we attribute the RM to internal Faraday rotation, then the motion of accreting material is inferred to be counterclockwise, contrary to inferences based on historical polarized flares, and no model satisfies all polarimetric and total intensity constraints. On the other hand, if we attribute the mean RM to an external Faraday screen, then the motion of accreting material is inferred to be clockwise, and one model passes all applied total intensity and polarimetric constraints: a model with strong magnetic fields, a spin parameter of 0.94, and an inclination of 150°. We discuss how future 345 GHz and dynamical imaging will mitigate our present uncertainties and provide additional constraints on the black hole and its accretion flow.",
