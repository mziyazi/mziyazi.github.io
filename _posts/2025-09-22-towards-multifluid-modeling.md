The Sun provides a unique opportunity to study stellar structure and dynamics at close range. Its proximity of about 150 million kilometers to Earth also makes our planet highly vulnerable to powerful solar storms. These eruptions can disrupt ground based power grids and interfere with communication and GPS satellites in orbit.

To mitigate these risks, reliable forecasting of solar storms and flaring events is essential. This need has driven the development of space weather prediction platforms supported by advanced magnetohydrodynamic modelling of the solar atmosphere and heliosphere. One of such deveoplmpemts has been realised by the time-implicit solver code called COCONUT.
